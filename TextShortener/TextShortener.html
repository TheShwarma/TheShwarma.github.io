<ul>
<li>Common words are replaced with number according to rarity</li>
<li>Numbers sorrunded with quatation marks</li>
<li>Unknown words are left as is</li>
<li>File extension: .STF (Short Text File)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:<br />Sentence <strong><code class="inline">I won the game 10 times, that was fun</code></strong> becomes <strong><code class="inline">18 won 1 484 "10" times, 10 12 586</code></strong>. <br />I is the 18th most common word and therefore becomes <code class="inline">18</code>. Won is not common an thus is left as it is.<br /> The 10 is surrounded with quotation marks to not make it confused as a code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>To do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix newline decoding, since currently it gets replaced with a space.</li>
<li>Fix text with quotation marks since if i have a word with quotation marks they'll get deleted since it'll be recognized as a protected number.</li>
<li>Add more words to the list</li>
<li>Set a working API instead of a simple command-line tool</li>
</ul>
